# Testing Framework Choice

We have chosen **Jest** as the primary testing framework for Netention for the following reasons:

*   **Ease of Use:** Jest provides a simple and intuitive API for writing tests.
*   **Rich Features:** Jest includes built-in support for mocking, code coverage, and snapshot testing.
*   **Large Community:** Jest has a large and active community, providing ample resources and support.
*   **Zero Configuration:** Jest requires minimal configuration, making it easy to get started.
*   **Integrated Assertion Library:** Jest comes with an integrated assertion library, eliminating the need for a separate dependency.
*   **Speed:** Jest is designed for speed and efficiency, making it well-suited for large projects.

While other testing frameworks such as Mocha and Jasmine are also viable options, Jest's combination of ease of use, rich features, and strong community support make it the best choice for Netention.
